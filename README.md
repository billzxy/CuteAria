# CuteAria
Another Aria2 Wrapper for Mac

A ready to go Swift application which combines aria2c and webui-aria2.

Usage:
Double click the application and icons should appear on menu bar.
Click the "A" on menu bar for more options.

Note: This repo includes webui-aria2 and aria2 files. These are not mine.

By using or downloading either the compiled binary or the aria2c.bin file, you agree with the license provided by aria2, available at http://aria2.sourceforge.net

TODO: 
1. Complete README.md someday.
2. Add status in menu bar.

License:
Standard GPLv2 License.
